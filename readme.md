## Course description

This two-part class is an introduction to R, an open-source programming language for reading, transforming, analyzing and visualizing data. By the end of the two sessions, you will have a basic foundation for getting started with R. While R is used to perform sophisticated statistical analysis and visualizations, these are beyond the scope of these introductory sessions. The goal is to jumpstart by focusing on the building blocks when working with data in R.


### Prerequisites:

Prior programming experience in any language preferred to feel comfortable typing code, creating variables, and using functions. R specific syntax will be discussed in class.

Some knowledge of basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range) and visualizations (bar graph and line graph) is recommended. Need a refresher? Watch this short video on basic statistics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_GBJhu65as).


### Tech requirements:

Your laptop (Mac, Windows, Linux) and charger. Note: A netbook or tablet is NOT a substitute.

An updated browser to access RStudio Cloud, a web version of R and RStudio. Please create a free account here (https://rstudio.cloud/).

To use R and RStudio locally on your computer, please install the latest release of R (version 3.5.0) and RStudio Desktop. Follow this step-by-step tutorial on how to install R and RStudio (https://tutorials.shinyapps.io/00-setup/#section-welcome). Since RStudio Cloud is a beta version, I recommend that you have a local installation as well.


### Topics covered:

-Understanding basic data structures in R
-Running R code interactively and via source files
-Installing and loading packages
-Exploring and subsetting a data set
-Understanding data with descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range)
-Visualizing data with basic graphs (bar chart, scatter plot, line graph)
-Learning of resources for connecting with the strong R community and deepening your understanding of R and statistics
